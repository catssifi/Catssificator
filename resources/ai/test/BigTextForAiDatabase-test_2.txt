SAN FRANCISCO — When bankers of the future decide whether to make a loan, they may look to see if potential customers use only capital letters when filling out forms, or at the amount of time they spend online reading terms and conditions — and not so much at credit history.

These signals about behavior — picked up by sophisticated software that can scan thousands of pieces of data about online and offline lives — are the focus of a handful of start-ups that are creating new models of lending.

No single signal is definitive, but each is a piece in a mosaic, a predictive picture, compiled by collecting an array of information from diverse sources, including household buying habits, bill-paying records and social network connections. It amounts to a digital-age spin on the most basic principle of banking: Know your customer.

“We're building the consumer bank of the future,” said Louis Beryl, chief executive of Earnest, one of the new lenders.

And in that bank, whether a customer uses proper capitalization and spends time reading terms and conditions of a loan may make him or her more creditworthy.

Quiz: How Big Data Lenders 
Size You Up
Finance start-ups are mining new sources of data to make lending decisions. Their algorithms look at thousands of digital signals of a person’s attributes and behavior, online and offline. No single one is definitive, and they are constantly being changed and updated. Test yourself to see how a few can be measured.


1How do you fill out forms online?
In all capital letters Capitalizing only the words at the beginning of sentences and proper names. In all lower case
2What kind of job suggests that you are more likely to make loan payments on time?

3Will a previous financial setback, like a bankruptcy, label you as a high-risk borrower?

Yes No

Yet the technology is so new that the potential is unproved. Also, applying the modern techniques of data science to consumer lending raises questions, especially for regulators who enforce anti-discrimination laws.

None of the new start-ups are consumer banks in the full-service sense of taking deposits. Instead, they are focused on transforming the economics of underwriting and the experience of consumer borrowing — and hope to make more loans available at lower cost for millions of Americans.

Earnest uses the new tools to make personal loans. Affirm, another start-up, offers alternatives to credit cards for online purchases. And another, ZestFinance, has focused on the relative niche market of payday loans.

They all envision consumer finance fueled by abundant information and clever software — the tools of data science, or big data — as opposed to the traditional math of creditworthiness, which relies mainly on a person’s credit history.

The new technology, proponents say, can open the door to far more accurate assessments of creditworthiness. Better risk analysis, they say, will broaden the lending market and reduce the cost of borrowing.

"The potential is there to save millions of people billions of dollars," said Rajeev V. Date, a venture investor and former banker, who also was deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Investors certainly see the potential; money and talent are flowing into this emerging market. Major banks, credit card companies and Internet giants are watching the upstarts and studying their techniques — and watching for the perils.

By law, lenders cannot discriminate against loan applicants on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age or the receipt of public assistance. Big-data lending, though, relies on software algorithms largely working on their own and learning as they go.

The danger is that with so much data and so much complexity, an automated system is in control. The software could end up discriminating against certain racial or ethnic groups without being programmed to do so.
Even enthusiasts acknowledge that pitfall. "A decision is made about you, and you have no idea why it was done,” Mr. Date said. “That is disquieting."


The data scientists focus on finding reliable correlations in the data rather than trying to determine why, for instance, proper capitalization may be a hint of creditworthiness.

“It is important to maintain the discipline of not trying to explain too much,” said Max Levchin, chief executive of Affirm. Adding human assumptions, he noted, could introduce bias into the data analysis.

Regulators are waiting to see how the new technology performs. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to encourage innovation but is monitoring the emerging market closely, said Patrice A. Ficklin, head of its fair lending office.

The data-driven lending start-ups see opportunity. As many as 70 million Americans either have no credit score or a slender paper trail of credit history that depresses their score, according to estimates from the National Consumer Reporting Association, a trade organization. Two groups that typically have thin credit files are immigrants and recent college graduates.

Affirm’s office in San Francisco looks nothing like a bank, occupying a couple of floors in an old red brick building. The work space is open with high ceilings, bare wood floors and rows of benchlike tables, where workers are hunched over computers.

The start-up began its credit card alternative for online purchases in July, but it is growing fast and has ambitious plans.
